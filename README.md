## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](httstatements://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](httstatements://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone httstatements://github.com/your-repo-url/draft-components.git
cd draft-components
pnpm install
```

### Scripts

#### Build the Components

Use Rollup to bundle the components for CommonJS and ES module output formats:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The bundled files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

#### Run Tests

Run the unit tests using Jest:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Development

To add new components:

1. Add your component files in the `src/` directory.
2. Ensure each file exports the component properly.
3. Update `rollup.config.js` if necessary.

You can find sample component files in `src/` to use as a template.

### Testing

Tests are written in the `tests/` directory, using Jest for unit tests. Make sure to add tests for any new components you create.

To run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Documentation

Check out the `docs/` folder for in-depth documentation about the individual components and utility functions.

## Roadmap

See `TODO.md` for planned features and improvements.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues and pull requests. Make sure to follow the project's code style and add tests for any changes.

# 🎨 Design Standard for Draft Components

## Core Essence

The Draft Components library aims to empower developers and UI designers to collaboratively solve UI problems in a coherent manner. Each component is designed with the intent to address specific challenges, ensuring that solutions are consistent, professional, and user-friendly. 🌟

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Unified Approach

Developers are encouraged to document UI problems in `docs/statements/TODO.md` and associated issues like `docs/issues/TODO.md`. 📝 Each documented problem serves as a reference point for how to approach solutions using Draft Components, allowing for a structured and collaborative resolution process.

### Migration and Implementation

As components evolve through the development cycle, any issues identified in documentation should be systematically addressed according to established standards. 🔄 This ensures that final implementations in frameworks like Vue.js maintain high quality and usability.

## Design Guidelines

- **Collaboration**: 🤝 Foster communication among developers and designers to identify common UI challenges and brainstorm effective solutions.
- **Documentation**: 📚 Thoroughly document problems and solutions, creating a shared knowledge base that informs future development.
- **Standards Adherence**: 📏 Follow established design standards to ensure consistency across all components, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Conclusion

The Draft Components library serves as a foundation for developers and UI designers to tackle challenges collaboratively and coherently. 🚀 By systematically addressing UI problems and adhering to shared standards, we can create a polished final product that effectively meets user needs. 💪
