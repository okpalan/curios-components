## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/draft-components.git
cd draft-components
pnpm install
```

### Scripts

#### Build the Components

Use Rollup to bundle the components for CommonJS and ES module output formats:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The bundled files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

#### Run Tests

Run the unit tests using Jest:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Development

To add new components:

1. Add your component files in the `src/` directory.
2. Ensure each file exports the component properly.
3. Update `rollup.config.js` if necessary.

You can find sample component files in `src/` to use as a template.

### Testing

Tests are written in the `tests/` directory, using Jest for unit tests. Make sure to add tests for any new components you create.

To run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Documentation

Check out the `docs/` folder for in-depth documentation about the individual components and utility functions.
