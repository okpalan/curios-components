### Example Draft Component Setup for Coworkers
Here’s how to structure an initial draft task for the team working on these components:

1. **Task: Create `noisy-button` Component**
   - **Goal**: Implement a button component with different styles (primary, secondary, danger) and states (hover, active, disabled).
   - **Accessibility Focus**: Ensure color contrast adheres to WCAG 2.1 standards (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1).
   - **Interactions**: Smooth transitions for hover/focus states, keyboard navigation support, and proper aria-labels.
   - **Test**: Test across light/dark themes and mobile/desktop devices.

2. **Task: Create `generic-grid-layout` Component**
   - **Goal**: Implement a responsive grid layout system with 12 columns, allowing for both fixed and fluid layouts.
   - **Responsiveness**: Ensure the grid collapses appropriately on smaller devices and remains flexible on larger screens.
   - **Test**: Verify the layout behaves correctly across multiple screen sizes.
