
# Design Standard for Draft Components

## Core Essence

The Draft Components library aims to empower developers and UI designers to collaboratively solve UI problems in a coherent manner. Each component is designed with the intent to address specific challenges, ensuring that solutions are consistent, professional, and user-friendly.

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Unified Approach

Developers are encouraged to document UI problems in `docs/ps/TODO.md` and associated issues like `docs/issues/TODO.md`. Each documented problem serves as a reference point for how to approach solutions using Draft Components, allowing for a structured and collaborative resolution process.

### Migration and Implementation

As components evolve through the development cycle, any issues identified in documentation should be systematically addressed according to established standards. This ensures that final implementations in frameworks like Vue.js maintain high quality and usability.

## Design Guidelines

- **Collaboration**: Foster communication among developers and designers to identify common UI challenges and brainstorm effective solutions.
- **Documentation**: Thoroughly document problems and solutions, creating a shared knowledge base that informs future development.
- **Standards Adherence**: Follow established design standards to ensure consistency across all components, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Conclusion

The Draft Components library serves as a foundation for developers and UI designers to tackle challenges collaboratively and coherently. By systematically addressing UI problems and adhering to shared standards, we can create a polished final product that effectively meets user needs.
